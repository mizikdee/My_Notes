**SQL is a Standard - BUT....**

1.Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language.
2.However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner.

Note: Most of the SQL database programs also have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL standard!
